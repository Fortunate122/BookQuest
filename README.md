# BookQuest

## Description  
BookQuest is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to search, save, and manage books using the Google Books API. Users can sign up, log in, and save books to their profile. Built with React, TypeScript, Apollo Client/Server, GraphQL, and MongoDB Atlas, the app supports a modern development workflow with Vite and TypeScript, and is deployed on Render.

## Motivation  
The goal behind BookQuest was to build a clean, full-stack app demonstrating secure authentication, GraphQL queries/mutations, and integration with an external API, all while maintaining scalability and clarity using modern TypeScript best practices.

## Usage  
BookQuest allows users to:
- Search for books by keyword (via Google Books API)  
- View results with details like author, title, and description  
- Sign up/log in to save books  
- View and manage saved books from a personal library  

The project demonstrates working knowledge of:
- GraphQL with Apollo Client/Server  
- JWT authentication  
- MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose for schema modeling  
- Vite/React with type-safe component logic  

## License  
This project is licensed under the None license.

## Learning  
I gained hands-on experience with setting up Apollo Server and Client, implementing a secure login flow, managing protected routes, and deploying a full-stack GraphQL app to Render using environment variables and production builds.

## Standout  
What makes BookQuest stand out is the ability to:
- Seamlessly integrate GraphQL on both client and server  
- Use token-based login and user-specific saved data  
- Deliver a responsive UI using React-Bootstrap  
- Operate with a fast Vite build system and strict TypeScript configs  
- Easily deploy via Render with automatic environment configuration
